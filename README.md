# BookItUp
A mobile application that allows a user to search for university course materials and purchase or rent them from other users. Vendors will be students who seek to sell old books. One of the important features is price comparison. We aim to compare prices between vendors to allow students to select the most affordable option. 

These are few screenshots of the app, and the logo as well
